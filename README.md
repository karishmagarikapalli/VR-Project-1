# VR-Project-1 Report

This is a web-based VR application that allows you to navigate through a decorated room and interact with select objects. The application was created using the A-Frame web framework. This project was completed for the purposes of the CS 5331 Virtual Reality class at Texas Tech University.

## Before and After COVID
The biggest impact COVID had on my life is forcing me indoors. I have since then adapted on multiple levels to the new lifestyle. Ever since TTU opened I have incorporated a few things in my living environment, like a COVID poster by the main door to remind myself to be safe everytime I step out and a sanitizer station as I enter the apartment.

## Conclusion
For this project, I designed a well-lit room that the user could navigate through and interact with select objects. The application is accessible through both a computer and phone; however, the computer navigation does have some small issues. Some obstacles were encountered when it came to warming up to the A-Frame and web development environments, but these issues were eventually eliminated. Overall, I completed a solid product that contains all the requirements to receive an excellent rating.
