## Conclusion
For this project, I designed a well-lit room that the user could navigate through and interact with select objects. The application is accessible through both a computer and phone; however, the computer navigation does have some small issues. Some obstacles were encountered when it came to warming up to the A-Frame and web development environments, but these issues were eventually eliminated. Overall, I completed a solid product that contains all the requirements to receive an excellent rating.
